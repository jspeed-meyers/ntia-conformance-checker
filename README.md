# ntia-conformance-checker

This 2022 Google Summer of Code project determines whether a [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) software bill of materials (SBOM) document contains the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) ["minimum elements."](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf)

The minimum elements include:
- Supplier Name
- Component Name
- Version of the Component
- Other Unique Identifiers
- Dependency Relationship
- Author of SBOM Data
- Timestamp

As defined by the NTIA, the minimum elements are "the essential pieces that support basic SBOM functionality and will serve as the foundation for an evolving approach to software transparency."
